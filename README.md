### Why is this presentation presented as a PDF in a GitHub repo instead of a more sensible format (like a PowerPoint presentation)?
The challenge requires entries to have a GitHub repo, and PDF files have nice previews on GitHub. Riot Git Gene requiring everyone to use GitHub is a pretty clear case of nepotism if you ask me.

### But I'm a challenger Yasuo one-trick who takes manaflow band every game
That is neither a question nor an acceptable life choice.
